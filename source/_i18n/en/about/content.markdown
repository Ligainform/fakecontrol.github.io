Fakecontrol is an independent civil project. We have no investors or funding and are neither media journalists nor media persons of any kind.

We work with hundreds of requests and messages on a daily basis and inspect every piece of information from every angle. We try to cover every article, whether it is main international news or local rumours.

Just like volunteers clean up streets of their cities, Fakecontrol team cleans up the Internet from fakes, canards and unchecked information.

We are trying to respond to your requests and letters as fast as we can and we would really appreciate your help — the more, the merrier.

Whether you want to share some news with us or just pat Fakecontrol team on the back, you can [email us](mailto:team@fakecontrol.org) or [send us](http://twitter.com/fakecontrol_org) a tweet. 

Fakecontrol team.
