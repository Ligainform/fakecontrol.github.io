Knowledge can change minds â€” that's what we've been learning for the last three months. High quality information that's been checked and then checked some more can really help to make objective and accountable decisions. That's why our team created this project and started to clean up the media space and find out what is true and what is fake, mainupulative or is a total canard. 

Unfortunately, we cannot check every article but we do hope that with your help, we will manage to keep the proccess fast and effective.


You can write us an [email](mailto:team@fakecontrol.org) or [tweet us](http://twitter.com/fakecontrol_org) an interesting link to investigate.

Respect in every aspect, Fakecontrol team.
