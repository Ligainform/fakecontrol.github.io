** UPD: the statement made by Andriy Parubiy (Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine) at March 2, 2014: ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0dLJcZBMM

Once the current post appears on Facebook - we experienced a lot of mess in comments.

We felt nervous about that so we decided to get in touch with state military registration and enlistment office at Kharkiv. Eventually we've got following response:

- Military offices watch the situation and people bother them with calls all the time.
- There is no official order regards military mobilization.
- The official order is pending signature from The President.
- The official order should be advertised on media (at least on national television network).
- There is no reason for panic.

We have a record of those conversation, but a permission to share was not granted - so we've listened to it by ourselves and you have to trust us. Or even better call to your local military office and ask appropriate questions :)

This is the most correct strategy in current situation.

We would not be surprised, if in the morning we will find out that Parubiy's Facebook page was hacked or it's just a fake account, which everybody read by unknown reason.

Please check all the information. Don't be fooled by fakes.
