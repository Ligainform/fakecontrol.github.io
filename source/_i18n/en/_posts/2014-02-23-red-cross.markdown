Olha Bohomolets in her post [said](https://www.facebook.com/olgabogomolets/posts/585812244842541) that the Ukrainian Red Cross Society refused to accept help from the Canadian Red Cross. This information was reposted by [Radio Svoboda](http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25270523.html) and [Argument](http://argumentua.com/novosti/ocherednaya-dikost-ukrainskii-krasnyi-krest-otkazalsya-peredat-pomoshch-iz-kanady)) on their pages. But there is an official verification that this information is false!

The International Committee of the Red Cross updated their  Twitter-account with the following [message](https://twitter.com/ICRC/status/436883171230367744) 
: “Rumour about Ukrainian Red Cross refusing aid from Canadian Red Cross is FALSE. @redcrosscanada didn’t send any official offer for aid.”

It means Canadian Red Cross did not offer their help to Ukranian Red Cross. It would be nice if all involved parts would clarify this issue. And you are welcome to share these news.Thanks a lot,Fakecontrol Team
