"Reliable sources also say that Lubka doesn't say hello, so she must be a slut, and that boyfriend of hers is a junkie!"These days we've heard quite a lot about Volodymyr Matvienko's decision to leave the Party of Regions. It is rumoured that he was forced to do so because his child has been kidnapped.

The source of this information is "Andrei Vajra, political analyst", as WA REX [tells us](http://www.iarex.ru/articles/45411.html) ("WA REX is Russian wire agency, not a foreign agent")

Andrey Vadzhra seems to be [frequently quoted](http://www.iarex.ru/keywords/601.html)
 by this agency.

We've had a look at the [analyst's blog](http://andreyvadjra.livejournal.com) on LiveJournal and found lots of wonderful stuff.

"Today, unknown people broke through a bank's wall and took all the money." Every word is amazing - just imagine them breaking (!) through a wall (!!!) and escaping with all (!!!) the money! (By the way, this amazing piece of news actually appeared in some Russian media, citing Mr Vadzhra's blog as the source).

"Apparently 236 deputies voted for removing riot police from the centre of Kyiv and cancelling the anti-terrorist operation. The chairman, however, did not sign the decree, so it cannot take effect." It's totally strange that a "political expert" doesn't know his own country's legislation. Dear Andrey, should you be reading this, here's an interesting [link](http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1861-17) for you, and [here](http://vybor.ua/article/zakonotvorchestvo/verhovnaya-rada-ukrainy-20-fevralya-2014.html) are some excerpts from the respective laws and some expert commentary as well).

"Armed skirmishes began between Berkut officers and the "Right Sector" neonazis in the centre of Kyiv. The Verkovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers have been evacuated. My sources inform that there is a fight in the Cabinet's building." Well yes, Andrey has the most reliable sources ever.

His [LJ blog](http://andreyvadjra.livejournal.com) and [website](http://alternatio.org/) are full of this kind of "news", they're totally worth looking at.

Do we need to say that it's not easy to believe things said by someone whose sources are SO reliable?
