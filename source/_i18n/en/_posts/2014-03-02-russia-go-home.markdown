## Background

So, Mrs. Matvienko described a few moments that pushed the Federation Council to accept the decisions that are being so widely discussed by people of Ukraine (and other countries). As Matvienko notes on the press conference, the approval of Russian President's application on authorising to move forces into Ukraine was conditioned by these key factors: (right now we advice you to open this [link](http://lifenews.ru/news/128189) and watch video at the beginning of the article)

## The statements
- Russian citizens were injured during the attempt to seize the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Crimea (5:30 and 06:12 on video)

- The abrogation of "On Russian Language" law and banning Russian speech in Ukraine (06:35 on video)

## Now comes the tasty part
- In his interview to [LB.ua](http://society.lb.ua/accidents/2014/03/01/257781_genkonsul_rossii_krimu.html) Vyacheslav Svetlichny, Russian consul general in Crimea, **disproved information** about victims.

- It is also worth mentioning that we never had "On Russian Language" law, and nobody forbade to speak Russian in our country, as we all know.

## A bit of personal opinion of the author
_though we don't practice that_

The whole Matviyenko's speech was saturated with one idea, which was emphasized many times. The speech amounts to the phrase "They beat up our guys" (and as we have seen, there was a lot of manipulations with that).
This phrase is very important - under this very slogan it is possible to get approval by the people to conduct active military actions. They beat up our guys, and it's our duty to defend them. But that is our conclusion, and you should make your conclusions yourself and write them in the comments section on the website or [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fakecontrol.org/posts/10202413009639817).
