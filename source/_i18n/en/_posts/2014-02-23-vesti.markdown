Once again, Russian TV channels distinguished themselves though their coverage of the events in Ukraine. Journalists from Vesti.ru on channel “Russia24” quite accidentally forgot to show the most important and interesting part of [the segment](http://www.vesti.ru/only_video.html?vid=578577).

For your comparison, [here](http://atn.ua/proisshestviya/kak-izbivali-pod-akademiey-vv-podrobnosti-shturma) are the same events covered by channel ATN Kharkov.

The urge to attach an old photo posted on the satirical Twitter account dedicated to the work of Dmitry Kiselev is irresistible.
