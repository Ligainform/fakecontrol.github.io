One more [news from Rada](http://www.gorodche.ru/news/society/30171/) (Ukrainian Parliament) turned out to be fake, or, to be more precise, an incorrect interpretation of the just adopted regulations.

In particular, the journalists of the mentioned news provider reckon, that the decision based on the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Regulation â„–65 dated 1/03/2014 rules the following:

> Fairs, festivals, conventions, celebrating commemorative and historical dates, Victory Day, Constitution Day, Independence Day and the Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims are also banned.

Let's refer to [the text of the regulation](http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/65-2014-%D0%BF), namely to the clause regarding the holidays, which will speak for itself:

> 20 Suspension of the use of budgetary funds for running events related to celebrating commemorative and historical dates, anniversaries of enterprises, institutions and organizations, along with anniversaries and commemoration of prominent figures and other events (except centralized Ministry of Culture events for celebrating 200 years from the day of birth of Taras Shevchenko, Constitution Day, Independence Day, Victory Day, Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims), printing production not related to exercise of functions of governmental authorities.

Obviously, nobody banned celebrating Victory Day, Constitution Day, Independence Day and the Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims.

The conclusions, as usual, are up to you.
