There is a [video on the web](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOmpICEfN5o) (shared couple of days ago) with the following description:

> **Posted on February 20, 2014.**
> American mercenaries fight on Maidan's side. It has been clearly demonstrated by the documents which were seized from the captured soldiers.

Below we may find “irrefutable” evidences:

_ID Cover_

_The Logo of a certain organization titled IPA_

_The ID itself_

Surprisingly, the police does not know of the existence of [IPA](http://www.ipa-ua.org) – an international police organization that Ukraine is a member of.

> The Ukrainian division of the International Police Association was created on April 25, 1996. In 1997, during the XV World Congress of the IPA in the Canadian city of Quebec, the Ukrainian section gained official recognition in the International Police Association. Today, the IPA comprises of about 8000 members. 
>
> Ukrainian IPA section works, consistently putting into practice the primary IPA motto: "Serve Through Friendship!". Communication with foreign colleagues, exchange of delegations, common international events - every activity by the Association members under our country's colors is a contribution of Ukrainian section of IPA to the extension of the professional and friendly relationships between law enforcement officers in different countries, and, eventually, to ensuring peace and friendship on our planet. 

The scariest part of the story that people blindly believe in such things. They believe in fake images without even checking obvious facts.
