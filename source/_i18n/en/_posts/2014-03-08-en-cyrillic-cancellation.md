While you were working for the good of your country and family, we were checking news for you, like we always do. And then we checked them all. And then we decided â€” hey, why not make a digest for every person who might have missed an article or two.
And here we go! 

### [2 Girls, 1 Fake](http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/2-girls-1-fake/)
Two women, who cry constantly and pray for Putin the Savior to come and, ahem, save them, turned out to be a lot more than just crying women. Changing cities, names and stories on daily basis, these two had a fabulous tour around Ukraine. We talk about their identities and get some very interesting comments from dentists and plastic surgeons. That may be the first time you read non-toxic comments so be aware!

### [Second passport, Third Sentence](http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/second-passport/)
Our all time favourite, Russia Today. They've been saying lately that having more than one citizenship may become punishable by criminal penalty. We tried hard to overcome our hysterical laughing and managed to tell you all why all that is just totally wrong.

### [USS That Couldn't Make It](http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/george-bush/)
A breathtaking story of George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier which never managed to get to the Crimea and instead just chilled in Greece. Besides explaining what is what, we send greeting to the team of Ukrainian TV channel ICTV and suggest that you should read Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits. It's fun reading, we promise!

### [About IMF "requirements"](http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/IMF-debunk/)
Your parents must've told you about crazy mortage payments and the disbandment of free education for your (hypothetical)kids. All that is IMF's fault! Except it's not and your parents were fooled, which we talk about a lot in our article. Anyway, are you really that sure you're ready to have kids?

### [About Cyrillic script being "cancelled"](http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/06/cyrillic-cancellation/)
The piece of news without reliable source in it is totally okay to post at one of the biggest news agencies site, right? We did not think so too! Latin alphabet is no cakewalk to suddenly start to use, especially in a country which was using Cyrillic script for many centuries. Fun historical facts as Friday bonus!
