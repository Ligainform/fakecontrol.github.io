I believe everyone has read/heard the [President's statement](http://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/30127.html).

Specifically, there are the following words:"Rybak came to me yesterday. While he was on his way to me, the car was fired on. He came to me and asked to take him away. I took him away and sent him to Donetsk by car to have medical treatment."

And today Vladimir Rybak uploaded [this video](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=639362169451922)) of him saying is saying that no one ever attempted the life of him.

Enjoy watching, we will refrain from conclusions.
