  <div class="entry-content"><p>Probably, you&rsquo;ve be working hard for the good of your country and didn&rsquo;t chill in social networks a lot. Unlike you, we were busy to sort out those news and prepare the following digest with the most famous, irregular and fake ones. Enjoy!</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/2-girls-1-fake/">2 Girls, 1 Fake</a></h3>

<p>Two women, who cry constantly and blame &ldquo;radical&rdquo; forces for &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; of their dear ukrainian cities. We tried to investigate their identities and shared our understanding with you. Changing cities, names and stories on daily basis, these two had a fabulous tour around Ukraine. Also we&rsquo;ve got some very interesting comments from dentists and plastic surgeons.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/second-passport/">Second passport, Third Sentence</a></h3>

<p>This one is from our all time favourite &ndash; Russia Today. They&rsquo;ve recently reported that having dual citizenship in Ukraine may become punishable offence. We tried hard to overcome our hysterical laughter and managed to explain why this is not true.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/george-bush/">USS That Couldn&rsquo;t Make It</a></h3>

<p>A breathtaking story about adventures of George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier, which never managed to get to the Crimea and just chilled in Greece instead. Besides explaining what is what, we send greetings to the team of Ukrainian TV channel &ldquo;ICTV&rdquo; and suggest everybody to read &ldquo;Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s fun reading, we promise!</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/IMF-debunk/">About IMF &ldquo;requirements&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>Your parents must&rsquo;ve told you about crazy mortage payments and the disbandment of free education for your (hypothetical) kids. All that is IMF&rsquo;s fault! Except it&rsquo;s not and your parents were fooled. We discussed those fact a lot in our article. Anyway, are you really sure that you&rsquo;re ready to have kids?</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/06/cyrillic-cancellation/">About Cyrillic script being &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>Is it totally fine to post an information on one of the biggest news agencies site without even mention to reliable source? We did not think so too! Latin alphabet is no cakewalk to suddenly start to use, especially in a country which was using Cyrillic script for many centuries. Fun historical facts as Friday bonus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s put on some light on the news about the possible abolition of the Cyrillic alphabet on the territory of Ukraine as <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20140305/998301560.html">RIA Novosti claims</a>.</p>

<p>The text of the news says that a special parliamentary commission is working on the law regulating the use of languages ​​in Ukraine and <em>&ldquo;the commission members are trying to use veiled wording in the bill to make a point about the phasing out of the Cyrillic alphabet&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>RIA Novosti makes the news on the message from <em>&ldquo;a source familiar with the situation in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament)&rdquo;</em>. We would like to point out that the text of the news does not provide the exact name of the source and there&rsquo;s no actual evidence by members of the committee (ie, no texts of bills or internal documents) that would contribute to the reliability of the news.  This news was <a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/23696">reprinted by Russia Today</a> along the way giving up the modest word &ldquo;source&rdquo;. However, we already <a href="/en/blog/2014/03/03/vtoroi-pasport/">put on some attention</a> on the peculiarities of Russia Today&rsquo;s work with information.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s try to understand what is really going on and is there any reason to believe the news and to fear that Ukraine will spend huge money for replacing all the official forms, documents, and street signs.</p>

<p>The Verkhovna Rada website <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/ru/news/Novosty/Soobshchenyya/89017.html">has reported</a> the beginning of the work of the commission. We are providing the version in Russian in case you want to learn more about it (no English version available, sorry!).</p>

<p>According to this report, the range of documents on which the new law is based, includes <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm">the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages​​</a>, the Law of Ukraine &ldquo;On ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages​​&rdquo; on May 15, 2003, аas well as the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation_on_languages_in_Ukraine">Law of Ukraine &ldquo;On state Language Policy of Ukraine &#8220;dated July 3, 2012</a>, which itself provided the Russian language the status of regional.</p>

<p>But we have not found anything about the replacement of the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin. As usual, we are not providing any conclusions, but we just want to note that the European Charter of regional languages ​​(by the way, not ratified by Russia) contains the following words at the beginning of the document:</p>

<p><em>protection and promotion of regional or minority languages ​​in different countries and regions of Europe represent an important contribution to the construction of a Europe based on the principles of democracy and cultural diversity within the framework of national sovereignty and territorial integrity</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s briefly explain the &ldquo;10 IMF Requirements&rdquo;, the acceptance of which is now considered to be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kostiantyn.stogniy/posts/657506810962958?stream_ref=5">Yatsenyuk&rsquo;s fault</a>.</p>

<p>This piece of &ldquo;breaking news&rdquo; is a bit outdated – it appeared about three years ago. <a href="http://ukranews.com/ru/news/economics/2010/12/07/32810">The Ukrainian News</a> just used an existing analytical article from Hvylya.org dated December 7, 2010. On December 8 a corresponding post <a href="http://hvylya.org/news/digest/wikileaks-15.html">appeared in the Hvylya.org digest</a>, but if you try to follow the links, you&rsquo;ll find out that the pages do not exist.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve found the document on Wikileaks. First of all, they are not &ldquo;obligatory requirements&rdquo;, but just <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10KYIV278_a.html">reform proposals</a>, given by Mr. Pynzenyk, whose name is openly mentioned there, in diplomatic correspondence,</p>

<p>The document is dated February 23, 2010. Let us remind you, how Ukraine cooperated with IMF in that period: in November 2008 the government of Yulia Tymoshenko received an IMF credit in the amount of USD 16.4 billion. In a year the Fund decided to freeze and cancel the credit, but instead of it <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/car081110a.htm">another credit</a> was given – USD 15.2 billion for the government under the President Yanukovych in July 2010. The second tranche of this credit in the amount of USD 1.5 billion was provided by the IMF Executive Board to Kyiv in December. But then the crediting was suspended, as the program requirements were not being fulfilled with due progress. The government of Yatsenyuk <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-28/imf-history-with-reneging-ukrainian-leaders-may-cloud-fresh-aid.html">will have to prove</a> the earnestness of their declarations and methods first.</p>

<p>Please see detailed chronology in the following <a href="http://economics.unian.net/other/854861-hronologiya-otnosheniy-ukrainyi-s-mvf.html">UNIAN article</a>. So Pynzenyk&rsquo;s letter was written in the period, when the 2008 credit was already suspended, and the 2010 credit was not being negotiated yet. On December 2013 this text <a href="http://blog.polemika.com.ua/blog/trebovaniy-mvf-ukraine-polnyy-spisok-jlya.html">appeared here</a>, and was readily republished by media. It is a 1:1 reprint of the letter dated 2010.</p>

<p>New IMF requirements haven&rsquo;t been formulated yet, and the existing ones can not be considered obligatory. Make your own conclusions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard that the U.S. aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush was deployed in the direction of Ukraine, you may have even read about it on ICTV&rsquo;s website <a href="http://fakty.ictv.ua/ru/index/read-news/id/1506591">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Due to the Russian invasion of the Crimea, the US have sent USS George H. W. Bush in the direction of the Black Sea.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;In response to a Russian invasion, the United States has sent an aircraft carrier strike group toward the Black Sea to be able to respond to developments on the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine&rdquo; reports &ldquo;Ukrainian News&rdquo;, citing the Turner Radio Network RSS Feed as the source.</p></blockquote>

<p>We read on the aircraft carrier&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/cvn77/Pages/USS%20GEORGE%20H.W.%20BUSH%20(CVN%2077).aspx">official website</a> that the carrier also has an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/USSGeorgeHWBush">official Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>After overcoming a fit of laughter at the idea of an aircraft carriers&#8217; crew running an official Facebook page, we read on the page that the ship actually <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/uss-george-hw-bush-cvn-77/uss-george-hw-bush-arrives-in-greece/666275313432490">arrived today in Greece</a>.</p>

<p>We send our kind regards to ICTV and the &ldquo;Ukrainian News&rdquo; ;)</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux_Convention_Regarding_the_Regime_of_the_Straits">Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits</a> states that this ship may enter into the Black Sea ONLY when Turkey is at war or if Turkey is under a threat of war. Complete text of Montreux Convention could be read <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Montreux_Convention">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening&rsquo;s sensation was a comparison of two rather viral videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onui6ivzf4o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m">one of which</a> was taken in Kharkov on March 1st (skip to 4:00) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OaeZ_mxG4g&amp;feature=player_embedded">the other one</a> in Sevastopol on March 3rd.</p>

<p>Both feature two women demonstrating a definitely pro-Russian rhetoric. First they describe the “mayhem” in Kharkov and then – in the other video – apparently the same women pretend to be Odessa citizens talking about the brutalities of Bandera&rsquo;s followers.Although everyone asserts that these are the same women, we cannot confirm it. We have watched both videos, taken snapshots of the women&rsquo;s faces and asked for the opinions of everyone we could, but could not come to a definite conclusion.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PeGt0Di.png" alt="EXHIBIT A" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/B7UFIkT.png" alt="EXHIBIT B" />More on this: we have received a video taken by the Crimean channel ATR that <a href="http://atr.ua/video/2014-03-03-15-53-26-2333215">shows a rally</a> in Simferopol featuring a rather similar person (skip to around 6:30). We also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=T6muI9tIqN0#t=638">video</a> from Odessa; we&rsquo;ll try to compare its soundtrack to that of the Sevastopol video.</p>

<p>You are welcome to make your own conclusions. If you have any relevant materials from the Kharkov, Sevastopol, or Simferopol rallies, please send them to us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We came across the news on the &ldquo;Russia Today&rdquo; channel, a channel that covers more than 644 million people in more than 100 countries, according to <a href="http://rt.com/about-us/">their own information</a>. The news is: <a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/23484">&ldquo;The Verkhovna Rada will introduce criminal liability for dual citizenship&rdquo;</a>.&ldquo;Verkhovna Rada&rdquo; is the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada">Ukrainian parliament</a></p>

<p>Dear 644 million of people in more than 100 countries! Unfortunately, we have to inform you that you have been deceived. We will not reflect over the reasons, instead we will just demonstrate why this information is false.</p>

<p>Here is what Russia Today saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Verkhovna Rada will consider a draft bill regarding criminal liability for dual citizenship after the situation in the country has been stabilised. This law (which provides for a prison sentence of 10 years for dual citizenship) has already been introduced into the Rada.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let’s navigate to <a href="http://rada.gov.ua">Verkhovna Rada official website</a> and find <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=49734">the corresponding bill draft</a>. Immediately we see the title:</p>

<blockquote><p>Draft of Law on Amendments to the Criminal Code of Ukraine regarding liability for <strong>failure to inform</strong> about obtaining a foreign citizenship by a citizen of Ukraine.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Having dual citizenship&rdquo; vs &ldquo;failure to inform about having dual citizenship&rdquo;. Minor omission, you say?</p>

<p>We could finish our investigation here, but it&rsquo;s way more interesting to dig deeper. So let&rsquo;s open the <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc34?id=&amp;pf3511=49734&amp;pf35401=290953">bill draft</a> and take a closer look at its regulations.</p>

<p>Hold on for a second. Let&rsquo;s take a look at original news again.</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the draft introduced into Ukraine&rsquo;s parliament, Ukrainian citizens who receive Russian passports will be fined and sentenced to 3-10 years of prison.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now let&rsquo;s look at the actual draft.</p>

<blockquote><p>Non-submitting or a belated submitting of an application informing about a voluntary acquiring of a foreign citizenship by a Ukrainian citizen of a legal age and of a copy of the document proving his/her acquiring of a foreign citizenship to an authorized body of central executive power is penalized by a fine of 100 minimum non-taxable incomes of citizens.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pause here for a second and check current definition of non-taxable minimum income. According to point 5 of chapter 10 of transitional provisions of Ukrainian Tax Code, a non-taxable minimum income is 17 UAH, 100 * 17 = 1700 UAH, a little bit less than 170 USD or 6100 RUR.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the bottom limit of a penal responsibility – 3 years. From the bill draft:</p>

<blockquote><p>The same actions committed by a citizen of Ukraine who <strong>used his/her right to vote</strong> in Ukraine are punishable by imprisonment for a term of 3 to 5 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now let&rsquo;s confirm an upper limit &ndash; 10 years. From the bill draft:</p>

<blockquote><p>The same actions, if committed by a citizen of Ukraine who has <strong>access to state secrets</strong>, are punishable by imprisonment for a term of 7 to 10 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>As usual, we won&rsquo;t draw any conclusions. But we note that the Russian Embassy in Ireland is located at a most interesting address: 184-186 Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin 14.</p>

<p>And let’s quote this undoubtedly great dystopian.</p>

<blockquote><p>War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The only thing worse than false information is attempting to use false information for profit. Fraudsters do not ignore current events. On a lot of online sources you may come across something of following kind:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o5hXQoD.png" alt="Imgur" />
(<em>phone numbers and Webmoney wallet numbers have been removed for obvious reasons</em>)</p>

<p>There is a translation of the letter above:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is our cry for help! We appeal to all indifferent people and the authorities! We are the families of the &ldquo;Berkut&rdquo; riot police force who live in a dormitory located in the Krasnozvezdniy Prospekt in Kiev. The last few months we have lived in constant fear for us, our husbands and children. Constant threats, bullying, fear have turned our life into a nightmare. Many of us had to quit their jobs and our children have been bullied at school because our husbands have &ldquo;killed people on the Maidan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Many of us have fled to our relatives, but some have nowhere to go and don&rsquo;t have enough money to flee. The last few days have been absolutely intolerable. All the time there are armed and masked men in front of the dormitory, they are numerous and very aggressive. They don&rsquo;t conceal that they have come to catch Berkut officers. They abuse everyone who enters or leaves the dormitory. They are absolutely unhinged &ndash; yesterday they even beat up the 60-year-old father of one of our women just because he had said something disrespectful about the Maidan. One of our children was walking his dog and these men broke the dog&rsquo;s legs with batons &ndash; and the child saw it all. It&rsquo;s a nightmare!</p>

<p>There are approximately 90 of us left, mostly women, children and older veterans. We also have some wounded young men &ndash; one of them has been badly beaten and had his bones broken, but he is afraid to go to the hospital because our officers are being kidnapped from hospitals.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t even ask for help. Some days ago we called the police &ndash; there came two sergeants and three masked men who threatened and abused us in front of our children and the police. We don&rsquo;t have an Internet connection (someone has cut all the cables) and we regularly have blackouts. We are eating up our last food &ndash; the potatoes and pasta that we&rsquo;ve somehow managed to gather.</p>

<p>Yesterday our husbands&#8217; bank cards were blocked &ndash; until the situation is cleared, they said &ndash; and now they&rsquo;re unemployed just for fulfilling their duty, for standing outside at 20 degrees below zero, for being burned and poisoned and shot at&hellip;</p>

<p>We have no more tears left &ndash; our husbands were abused so much, and then betrayed! We had a phone call from Lvov today &ndash; a Berkut officer was killed in his own home because he had been at the Maidan. We don&rsquo;t know whom to trust, how to get help and how to feed our children. If someone could help with accommodation for a few months (also in villages), we would be very grateful. We would also be grateful for anything you could bring to our address, Krasnozvezdniy 152a. Some of us also need money to pay for their mobile connection, we receive a lot of calls and we only have mobile Internet left.</p></blockquote>

<p>We contacted with the 4th Dormitory of GU MVD in Ukraine. Their phone number (044) 524-36-96 is in open access to anyone. We&rsquo;ve been told that they have everything and need no help.</p>

<p>We are also happy to learn, that we are not the only ones, who are critical about emotionally charged information. Users of a <a href="http://forum.sevastopol.info/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=752766&amp;start=375&amp;fb_source=message">Sevastopol forum</a> have also called both the dormitory and the people, whose numbers appeared in the appeal for help. They have also been told, that the dormitory does not need help. Calls to the numbers given in the appeal were either left unanswered or there was no connection whatsoever.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is: this information is fake; it is also an attempt to make money on other people&rsquo;s suffering.</p>

<p>If you really want to donate to a good cause &ndash; donate to «<a href="http://tabletochki.org/welcome">Tabletochki</a>» (the red button that says &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;; it works with all kinds of bank cards). The previous government has decided to spend just 50 million UAH (around 5 million EUR) on children who suffer from cancer, which is 4,5 times less than in 2013 and covers just 20% of the real needs (216 million UAH). &ldquo;Ohmatdit&rdquo; &ndash; the most important clinic for such patients &ndash; has mouldy walls.</p>

<p>We can guarantee the honesty of &ldquo;Tabletochki&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every day brings new reasons to wonder . Today we were absolutely surprised with unique understanding of geography by the &ldquo;Pervyy kanal&rdquo; tv channel in Russia.</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/posts/2014-03-02/poland.jpg" alt="140,000 refugees" /></p>

<p>In the news story &ldquo;More and more Ukraine citizens arrive to the southern Russian regions&rdquo; First Channel claims that</p>

<p>more than 140 000 people crossed the Russian border in the last two weeks. Among them are not only the residents of Ukraine&rsquo;s East and South, but also of central and western regions.</p>

<p>We are ready to believe the fact that inhabitants of western regions cross the border, however it&rsquo;s claimed that people of Ukraine come to &ldquo;Kursk, Belgorod , Rostov and Bryansk regions &rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re curious whether Poland is aware that it is the part of Russia. Border crossing point Sheginy (the sign can be seen at 00:14 on the video) is situated in Lviv region and is a checkpoint on the border with Poland.</p>

<p><a href="http://service.alfard-bel.ru/tamogna-online-nehoteevka.html">Webcams</a> also transmit empty roads</p>

<p>The project team hopes that the management of the First Channel will deliver a reprimand to their employees and will force them to love geography &ndash; after all, in a ticklish propaganda and fake business such mistakes are a major failure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we found a picture that shows one of the most famous Hitler portraits hanging over the entrance to Kyiv Municipal State Administration. One could laugh, but the image is quickly being shared by Russian trashy websites, low quality personal blogs, local European news sources and social networks.</p>

<p>If you open the image in Adobe Photoshop and apply Rainbow Curve over the image, you may found that the portrait&rsquo;s density is different from the rest of the picture. But this isn’t even necessary, as you can spot the editing with the naked eye.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Olha Bohomolets in her post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/olgabogomolets/posts/585812244842541">said</a> that the Ukrainian Red Cross Society refused to accept help from the Canadian Red Cross. This information was reposted by <a href="http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25270523.html">Radio Svoboda</a> and <a href="http://argumentua.com/novosti/ocherednaya-dikost-ukrainskii-krasnyi-krest-otkazalsya-peredat-pomoshch-iz-kanady">Argument</a>) on their pages. But there is an official verification that this information is false!</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross updated their  Twitter-account with the following <a href="https://twitter.com/ICRC/status/436883171230367744">message</a>
: “Rumour about Ukrainian Red Cross refusing aid from Canadian Red Cross is FALSE. @redcrosscanada didn’t send any official offer for aid.”</p>

<p>It means Canadian Red Cross did not offer their help to Ukranian Red Cross. It would be nice if all involved parts would clarify this issue. And you are welcome to share these news.Thanks a lot,
Fakecontrol Team</p>
