  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since March 20th rumour has it that Yatseniuk&rsquo;s goverment is planning to withdraw the hryvnia from circulation. Nothing dramatic at first glance: changing old hryvnia for new ones. However situation gets tense quite quickly &ndash; it is beleived that the goverment will collapse and withdraw the hryvnia. Some even go as far as telling &lsquo;&#8217;remember how it happened in the USSR&rsquo;&lsquo; when new roubles were changes to new ones at a rate different than 1:1. This possibly targets older people as for most youth scary stories about the USSR do not have much of an effect.</p>

<p>The actual article can be found <a href="http://odessitos1.livejournal.com/4588.html">here</a> (if the author deletes it we have everything saved separately). The whole livejournal is quite one-sided and although the author claims to just have the intention to clear things out, the article subtly injects tensions. The blog was <a href="http://odessitos1.livejournal.com/profile">created</a> on March 10th 2014. The author began writing the post about the hryvnia
<a href="http://odessitos1.livejournal.com/795.html">almost</a> since registering. His first writings began with «predictions».</p>

<p>Through this link you will find 5 reasons why this was made up, although more elegantly than usual:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are discrepancies in numbers being reported by Russian media regarding Crimean voters in the referendum.
According to Russian media, in particular <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2014/03/15_a_5951217.shtml">gazeta.ru</a></p>

<blockquote><p>81.36% of Crimean voters presented themselves as of 20:00 (22:00 Moscow time). Mihail Malyshev, president of the supreme commission of Crimea, and the person responsible for organizing and holding referendums, announced this number.</p>

<p>He stated that, «As of 20:00 (8 p.m.), 1,250,426 people cast their votes in Crimea. This is excluding Sevastopol … If we also add Sevastopol, a total of 1,724,563 people cast their votes.»</p></blockquote>

<p>In attempting to verify this information, we discovered discrepancies.
As seen in <a href="http://youtu.be/hBf7-b3IyIA?t=3m55s">the video footage</a> announcing these numbers, Malyshev said <strong>1,524,563</strong> voters cast their ballots and not 1,724,563. ITAR-TASS made this mistake in the original news report, which was then picked up by other Russian media, numerous analysers, and even ourselves and <a href="http://stopfake.org/">StopFake</a>. This resulted in reports of a <a href="http://teh-nomad.livejournal.com/2007998.html">123% participation rate</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://youtu.be/hBf7-b3IyIA?t=15m20s">in the same video at minute 15</a> we hear information about <strong>1,724,563</strong>, which creates double confusion and seems to be the original source of this misinformation.</p>

<p>We implore journalists to please verify information they receive.
Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One more <a href="http://www.gorodche.ru/news/society/30171/">news from Rada</a> (Ukrainian Parliament) turned out to be fake, or, to be more precise, an incorrect interpretation of the just adopted regulations.</p>

<p>In particular, the journalists of the mentioned news provider reckon, that the decision based on the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Regulation №65 dated 1/03/2014 rules the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fairs, festivals, conventions, celebrating commemorative and historical dates, Victory Day, Constitution Day, Independence Day and the Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims are also banned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s refer to <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/65-2014-%D0%BF">the text of the regulation</a>, namely to the clause regarding the holidays, which will speak for itself:</p>

<blockquote><p>20 Suspension of the use of budgetary funds for running events related to celebrating commemorative and historical dates, anniversaries of enterprises, institutions and organizations, along with anniversaries and commemoration of prominent figures and other events (except centralized Ministry of Culture events for celebrating 200 years from the day of birth of Taras Shevchenko, Constitution Day, Independence Day, Victory Day, Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims), printing production not related to exercise of functions of governmental authorities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Obviously, nobody banned celebrating Victory Day, Constitution Day, Independence Day and the Day of commemoration of Holodomors victims.</p>

<p>The conclusions, as usual, are up to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are being aggressively offered to believe another sensation from an allegedly hacked mailbox. This time the &ldquo;data leak&rdquo; has been presented as follows:</p>

<p><em>We have hacked e-mail correspondence of US Army Attache Assistant in Kiev Jason Gresh and a high ranking official from Ukrainian General Staff Igor Protsyk</em>.</p>

<p>An archive of messages, allegedly from the <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> mailbox, was <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/ih96tx">published</a>. The package contains two folders – &ldquo;most interesting&rdquo; with three scandalous e-mails, which have been spread all over the Internet, and &ldquo;all&rdquo; with the complete archive of 86 messages.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve analyzed the &ldquo;all&rdquo; folder and would like to make the following statements on the three &ldquo;most interesting&rdquo; messages:</p>

<p><strong>E-mail #1</strong>: from <code>GreshJP@state.gov</code> to <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>, delivered on 9 Mar 2014 08:57:15 -0700.</p>

<p>It looks very different from the rest five messages between the same users (<code>GreshJP@state.gov</code> to <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>) in the &ldquo;all&rdquo; folder (an obvious difference in English skills is just one of them). For example, all the content of this message belongs to the &ldquo;text/plain&rdquo; data type (the other ones are multipart/related, with HTML part). Besides that, this message does not end with the notice &ldquo;SBU This email is UNCLASSIFIED&rdquo; (SBU, Sensitive But Unclassified – a designation of information in the United States government).</p>

<p><strong>E-mail #2</strong>: from <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> to <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code>, delivered on 11 Mar 2014 05:50:36 -0700.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V7ZoaGa.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>This message, unlike all the other archived ones sent by <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>, has a valid DKIM-signature and headers confirming its delivery to <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code>. The presence of those headers makes it clear that the message was extracted from the <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code> mailbox, not from <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> (that is from the recipient mailbox, though the archive has nothing to do with it).</p>

<p>That means that the hackers had access not only to the mailbox of <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>, but also to <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code>; that&rsquo;s true for E-mail #3 as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>E-mail #3</em></strong>: from <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code> to <code>kolyarny@gmail.com</code> (by the way, the latter mailbox can be found on the Web only in the context of the &ldquo;data leak&rdquo; in question) and to <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>, delivered on 11 Mar 2014 09:20:47 -0700.</p>

<p>Besides that the archive contains a message from <code>no-reply@accounts.google.com</code> to <code>protsyk@ukr.net</code> with password recovery information, delivered on 11 Mar 2014 05:47:11 -0700 (before sending of E-mails #2 and #3). Judging by the fact that there are 21 more e-mails to <code>protsyk@ukr.net</code> in the archive, the messages from that address are being forwarded to <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>You are free to make your own conclusions, but here are some hints from us:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The hackers declared that they had access to the <code>GreshJP@state.gov</code> and <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> mailboxes. But all the published messages between these two addresses are obviously not trustworthy, as they could have been written by the hackers themselves. The hackers most likely had no access to <code>GreshJP@state.gov</code>, because E-mail #1 was clumsily forged on the basis of the rest five &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; messages from <code>GreshJP@state.gov</code> found in the <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> mailbox.</p></li>
<li><p>The message from <code>no-reply@accounts.google.com</code> gives us reasons to suppose that E-mails #2 and #3 have been sent after the <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> mailbox was compromised; that means that those e-mails could have been sent by the hackers themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>E-mail #2 proves that the hackers had access to <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code>, so why couldn&rsquo;t E-mail #3 have been created by the hackers?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This time the &ldquo;Anonymous Ukraine&rdquo; authors of the mail hacking scandal concerning the Crimea provocations made a <a href="http://fakecontrol.org/blog/2014/03/02/anon-fake/">far less clumsy try</a>. The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM-signatures</a> are doubtlessly proving the hacking of the <code>igor.protsyk@gmail.com</code> and <code>krivonis.te@gmail.com</code> mailboxes. But the results of the comparison between the &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; and all the other archived messages suggest with a high probability that the e-mails, which have so providently been placed in a separate directory under the meaningful name &ldquo;most interesting&rdquo;, have been forged or sent by the hackers themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, March 7, the official website of Batkivshchyna (Yulia Tymoshenko&rsquo;s political party) <a href="http://batkivshchyna.com.ua/news/open/1059">informed</a> its readers about the meeting between Tymoshenko and Angela Merkel.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want you to be confused about the meeting&rsquo;s scope and participants, so we&rsquo;ll add just two small details to this piece of <a href="news:">news:</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>This was a collective event with the participation of Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko and Angela Merkel, not a one-on-one meeting between two major politicians, as some people are trying to present it. Do you want a proof? Here you are: a <a href="https://twitter.com/RegSprecher/status/441916443995553793/photo/1">tweet</a> of Steffen Seibert (the German Chancellor&rsquo;s press-secretary).</p></li>
<li><p>It was a short talk along the lines of summit – here&rsquo;s Stern&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-krise-prorussische-kaempfer-stuermen-armeebasis-auf-der-krim-2094923.html">report</a> about it, and here are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trinitycollegedublin/posts/828271160521319?stream_ref=10">some pictures</a> from the Trinity College of Dublin, where Merkel gave a speech about &ldquo;globalized Europe&rdquo; after the event.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Many Ukrainian media have already republished the photo from Tymoshenko&rsquo;s party website. It&rsquo;s a pity that the situation is being completely and deliberately misinterpreted. The fact is that Merkel met two representatives of Ukrainian political parties during the Dublin summit, to which she invited them herself. Instead of that some people try to convince us that &ldquo;Yulia is a strong politician, and even Merkel finds some time in her schedule to talk to her&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t act that way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We would like to give up walking on the thin ice of the language problem, but our beloved media does not let us to do so. At this time, the reader put on the alarm sending us a completely unbelievable <a href="http://itar-tass.com/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1029332">news</a> that the Administration of acting President of Ukraine Turchynov ordered to remove Russian-language versions of the official websites of public authorities. Perhaps we analyze the news thoroughly.</p>

<blockquote><p>KIEV, March 7. / ITAR-TASS /. Administration of appointed by the Verkhovna Rada Acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov has ordered to the Ukrainian bodies of state power to enable Russian-language versions of their official websites, as the source in the Cabinet of Ministers reports to ITAR-TASS .</p></blockquote>

<p>So, the first thing that can cause some doubts. Unknown &ldquo;source&rdquo; reports &ndash; as if about an already made decision, consequently, there is no sence for this source to hide. Our inner barometer automatically moved a pointer to the section &ldquo;fake&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Until March 10 all Ukrainian executive, legislative and judicial state authorities must block the access to the Russian versions of their official websites,&rdquo; &ndash; he said. According to the source, the Russian versions of internet pages of 14 key ministries are eliminated by now: the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Social Policy and others, as well as web portals of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Economic Court of Ukraine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, a mysterious source didn&rsquo;t take into account that it is quite easy to check such order. We will use <a href="http://archive.org/web/">Internet Wayback Machine</a> service. It will be fun!</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Moreover, the Russian language has disappeared from the official web pages of central executive bodies of special status: the Security Service, the Antimonopoly Committee, etc.,&rdquo; &ndash; the source added.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same applies to the Security Service and the Antimonopoly Committee &ndash; Russian version either exists or there was no before.</p>

<p>We have got two questions on this subject.</p>

<p>First, the Ministry of Finance, for how long will you neglect the order of <em>Acting President</em> (a fake one)? Boo, saboteurs!</p>

<p>The second one requires a <a href="http://itar-tass.com/pages/tass-today">quotation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nowadays, the amount of information produced in the world is growing exponentially, so the question of its authenticity becomes acute. It is therefore of paramount importance to ITAR-TASS team the authenticity of the information received by our subscribers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hey ITAR-TASS (The Information Telegraph Agency of Russia), shame on you!</p>

<p>P.S. The one, who would find the Russian versions of the above mentioned pages, will get a beautiful picture a of pug from us for free!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: &ldquo;News&rdquo; by ITAR-TASS, seems to be picked up by everybody including the Echo of Moscow, Kommersant and RT:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Probably, you&rsquo;ve be working hard for the good of your country and didn&rsquo;t chill in social networks a lot. Unlike you, we were busy to sort out those news and prepare the following digest with the most famous, irregular and fake ones. Enjoy!</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/2-girls-1-fake/">2 Girls, 1 Fake</a></h3>

<p>Two women, who cry constantly and blame &ldquo;radical&rdquo; forces for &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; of their dear ukrainian cities. We tried to investigate their identities and shared our understanding with you. Changing cities, names and stories on daily basis, these two had a fabulous tour around Ukraine. Also we&rsquo;ve got some very interesting comments from dentists and plastic surgeons.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/03/second-passport/">Second passport, Third Sentence</a></h3>

<p>This one is from our all time favourite &ndash; Russia Today. They&rsquo;ve recently reported that having dual citizenship in Ukraine may become punishable offence. We tried hard to overcome our hysterical laughter and managed to explain why this is not true.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/george-bush/">USS That Couldn&rsquo;t Make It</a></h3>

<p>A breathtaking story about adventures of George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier, which never managed to get to the Crimea and just chilled in Greece instead. Besides explaining what is what, we send greetings to the team of Ukrainian TV channel &ldquo;ICTV&rdquo; and suggest everybody to read &ldquo;Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s fun reading, we promise!</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/04/IMF-debunk/">About IMF &ldquo;requirements&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>Your parents must&rsquo;ve told you about crazy mortage payments and the disbandment of free education for your (hypothetical) kids. All that is IMF&rsquo;s fault! Except it&rsquo;s not and your parents were fooled. We discussed those fact a lot in our article. Anyway, are you really sure that you&rsquo;re ready to have kids?</p>

<h3><a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/06/cyrillic-cancellation/">About Cyrillic script being &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>Is it totally fine to post an information on one of the biggest news agencies site without even mention to reliable source? We did not think so too! Latin alphabet is no cakewalk to suddenly start to use, especially in a country which was using Cyrillic script for many centuries. Fun historical facts as Friday bonus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>U.S. Department of State <a href="http://russian.moscow.usembassy.gov/factsheet-ukraine-03062014.html">published</a> a fact sheet disproving some of the statements Putin has made about Ukraine.</p>

<p>We decided to quote this list on our website as well:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Russian forces in Crimea are only acting to protect Russian military assets. It is “citizens’ defense groups,” not Russian forces, who have seized infrastructure and military facilities in Crimea.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: Strong evidence suggests that members of Russian security services are at the heart of the highly organized anti-Ukraine forces in Crimea. While these units wear uniforms without insignia, they drive vehicles with Russian military license plates and freely identify themselves as Russian security forces when asked by the international media and the Ukrainian military. Moreover, these individuals are armed with weapons not generally available to civilians.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Russia’s actions fall within the scope of the 1997 Friendship Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: The 1997 agreement requires Russia to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Russia’s military actions in Ukraine, which have given them operational control of Crimea, are in clear violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: The opposition failed to implement the February 21 agreement with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: The February 21 agreement laid out a plan in which the Rada, or Parliament, would pass a bill to return Ukraine to its 2004 Constitution, thus returning the country to a constitutional system centered around its parliament. Under the terms of the agreement, Yanukovych was to sign the enacting legislation within 24 hours and bring the crisis to a peaceful conclusion. Yanukovych refused to keep his end of the bargain. Instead, he packed up his home and fled, leaving behind evidence of wide-scale corruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Ukraine’s government is illegitimate. Yanukovych is still the legitimate leader of Ukraine.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: On March 4, President Putin himself acknowledged the reality that Yanukovych “has no political future.” After Yanukovych fled Ukraine, even his own Party of Regions turned against him, voting to confirm his withdrawal from office and to support the new government. Ukraine’s new government was approved by the democratically elected Ukrainian Parliament, with 371 votes – more than an 82% majority. The interim government of Ukraine is a government of the people, which will shepherd the country toward democratic elections on May 25th – elections that will allow all Ukrainians to have a voice in the future of their country.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: There is a humanitarian crisis and hundreds of thousands are fleeing Ukraine to Russia and seeking asylum.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: To date, there is absolutely no evidence of a humanitarian crisis. Nor is there evidence of a flood of asylum-seekers fleeing Ukraine for Russia. International organizations on the ground have investigated by talking with Ukrainian border guards, who also refuted these claims. Independent journalists observing the border have also reported no such flood of refugees.
(editor&rsquo;s note: we&rsquo;ve already <a href="http://fakecontrol.org/en/blog/2014/03/02/first_channel_geography/">covered</a> this issue)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Ethnic Russians are under threat.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: Outside of Russian press and Russian state television, there are no credible reports of any ethnic Russians being under threat. The new Ukrainian government placed a priority on peace and reconciliation from the outset. President Oleksandr Turchynov refused to sign legislation limiting the use of the Russian language at regional level. Ethnic Russians and Russian speakers have filed petitions attesting that their communities have not experienced threats. Furthermore, since the new government was established, calm has returned to Kyiv. There has been no surge in crime, no looting, and no retribution against political opponents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Russian bases are under threat.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: Russian military facilities were and remain secure, and the new Ukrainian government has pledged to abide by all existing international agreements, including those covering Russian bases. It is Ukrainian bases in Crimea that are under threat from Russian military action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: There have been mass attacks on churches and synagogues in southern and eastern Ukraine.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: Religious leaders in the country and international religious freedom advocates active in Ukraine have said there have been no incidents of attacks on churches. All of Ukraine’s church leaders, including representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, have expressed support for the new political leadership, calling for national unity and a period of healing. Jewish groups in southern and eastern Ukraine report that they have not seen an increase in anti-Semitic incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: Kyiv is trying to destabilize Crimea.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: Ukraine’s interim government has acted with restraint and sought dialogue. Russian troops, on the other hand, have moved beyond their bases to seize political objectives and infrastructure in Crimea. The government in Kyiv immediately sent the former Chief of Defense to defuse the situation. Petro Poroshenko, the latest government emissary to pursue dialogue in Crimea, was prevented from entering the Crimean Rada.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mr. Putin says</strong>: The Rada is under the influence of extremists or terrorists.<br/>
<strong>The Facts</strong>: The Rada is the most representative institution in Ukraine. Recent legislation has passed with large majorities, including from representatives of eastern Ukraine. Far-right wing ultranationalist groups, some of which were involved in open clashes with security forces during the EuroMaidan protests, are not represented in the Rada. There is no indication that the Ukrainian government would pursue discriminatory policies; on the contrary, they have publicly stated exactly the opposite.</p></li>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take the Russian MFA long to <a href="http://mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/C48637A3360452D044257C9300518BDD">respond</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>A ministry spokesman, Aleksandr K. Lukashevich, commented on the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s &ldquo;factual rationales&rdquo; regarding the situation in Ukraine:</strong></p>

<p>The statement &ldquo;disproving&rdquo; the facts mentioned by the President of Russia V. Putin at the press conference on 4th of March about the situation in Ukraine, posted on U.S. Department of State website, is shocking, not as much for its primitive distortion of reality as its cynicism and overt ‘double standards&#8217;.</p>

<p>The State Department is trying to play on a shamelessly one-sided interpretation of events, as if there was not plentiful evidence of atrocities committed by radical nationalists, including the massacre of inconvenient people captured on video cameras, or the murder by provocateur snipers. Washington, of course, can&rsquo;t acknowledge that it nourished &ldquo;Maidan&rdquo; itself, and encouraged the violent overthrow of power, preparing the way for those who now pass themselves off as a legitimate authorities in Kyiv.</p>

<p>We will not stoop as low as to argue with this low-grade propaganda. We will only say that once again we are dealing with unacceptable arrogance and the false assumption of the ultimate truth. The United States doesn’t and can’t have the moral right to lecture us about compliance of international norms. What about the former Yugoslavia bombing or Iraqi invasion under a fabricated motive?</p>

<p>If examining the near distant past, we can find a lot of cases of American military interventions far away from its national borders and without any real threat to the safety of the United States. The Vietnam War claimed two millions of civilians, completely devastated the country, and created a toxic environment. Under the pretense of defending its citizens, that just happened to be in the conflict zone, USA invaded Lebanon in 1958, the Dominican Republic in 1965, attacked tiny Grenada in 1983, bombed Libya in 1986, and three years later occupied Panama. Nevertheless, they dare to reproach Russia for ‘armed aggression’ when she stands up for her countrymen, who constitute the majority of the Crimean people, so as to prevent ultranationalist forces from arranging another bloody &ldquo;Maidan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Obviously, Washington is still not able to accept the course of events when it contradicts their opinion. They cannot get over it and come to terms with the fact that they cannot always dictate their will and act in their customary role of ‘infallible judge,’ which is followed by — the last word. Their nerves are giving out, but that is no reason to thrust guilt on the innocent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s put on some light on the news about the possible abolition of the Cyrillic alphabet on the territory of Ukraine as <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20140305/998301560.html">RIA Novosti claims</a>.</p>

<p>The text of the news says that a special parliamentary commission is working on the law regulating the use of languages ​​in Ukraine and <em>&ldquo;the commission members are trying to use veiled wording in the bill to make a point about the phasing out of the Cyrillic alphabet&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>RIA Novosti makes the news on the message from <em>&ldquo;a source familiar with the situation in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament)&rdquo;</em>. We would like to point out that the text of the news does not provide the exact name of the source and there&rsquo;s no actual evidence by members of the committee (ie, no texts of bills or internal documents) that would contribute to the reliability of the news.  This news was <a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/23696">reprinted by Russia Today</a> along the way giving up the modest word &ldquo;source&rdquo;. However, we already <a href="/en/blog/2014/03/03/vtoroi-pasport/">put on some attention</a> on the peculiarities of Russia Today&rsquo;s work with information.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s try to understand what is really going on and is there any reason to believe the news and to fear that Ukraine will spend huge money for replacing all the official forms, documents, and street signs.</p>

<p>The Verkhovna Rada website <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/ru/news/Novosty/Soobshchenyya/89017.html">has reported</a> the beginning of the work of the commission. We are providing the version in Russian in case you want to learn more about it (no English version available, sorry!).</p>

<p>According to this report, the range of documents on which the new law is based, includes <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm">the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages​​</a>, the Law of Ukraine &ldquo;On ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages​​&rdquo; on May 15, 2003, аas well as the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation_on_languages_in_Ukraine">Law of Ukraine &ldquo;On state Language Policy of Ukraine &#8220;dated July 3, 2012</a>, which itself provided the Russian language the status of regional.</p>

<p>But we have not found anything about the replacement of the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin. As usual, we are not providing any conclusions, but we just want to note that the European Charter of regional languages ​​(by the way, not ratified by Russia) contains the following words at the beginning of the document:</p>

<p><em>protection and promotion of regional or minority languages ​​in different countries and regions of Europe represent an important contribution to the construction of a Europe based on the principles of democracy and cultural diversity within the framework of national sovereignty and territorial integrity</em>.</p>
