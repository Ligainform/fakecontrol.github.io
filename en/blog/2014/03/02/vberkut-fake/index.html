  <div class="entry-content"><p>The only thing worse than false information is attempting to use false information for profit. Fraudsters do not ignore current events. On a lot of online sources you may come across something of following kind:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o5hXQoD.png" alt="Imgur" />
(<em>phone numbers and Webmoney wallet numbers have been removed for obvious reasons</em>)</p>

<p>There is a translation of the letter above:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is our cry for help! We appeal to all indifferent people and the authorities! We are the families of the &ldquo;Berkut&rdquo; riot police force who live in a dormitory located in the Krasnozvezdniy Prospekt in Kiev. The last few months we have lived in constant fear for us, our husbands and children. Constant threats, bullying, fear have turned our life into a nightmare. Many of us had to quit their jobs and our children have been bullied at school because our husbands have &ldquo;killed people on the Maidan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Many of us have fled to our relatives, but some have nowhere to go and don&rsquo;t have enough money to flee. The last few days have been absolutely intolerable. All the time there are armed and masked men in front of the dormitory, they are numerous and very aggressive. They don&rsquo;t conceal that they have come to catch Berkut officers. They abuse everyone who enters or leaves the dormitory. They are absolutely unhinged &ndash; yesterday they even beat up the 60-year-old father of one of our women just because he had said something disrespectful about the Maidan. One of our children was walking his dog and these men broke the dog&rsquo;s legs with batons &ndash; and the child saw it all. It&rsquo;s a nightmare!</p>

<p>There are approximately 90 of us left, mostly women, children and older veterans. We also have some wounded young men &ndash; one of them has been badly beaten and had his bones broken, but he is afraid to go to the hospital because our officers are being kidnapped from hospitals.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t even ask for help. Some days ago we called the police &ndash; there came two sergeants and three masked men who threatened and abused us in front of our children and the police. We don&rsquo;t have an Internet connection (someone has cut all the cables) and we regularly have blackouts. We are eating up our last food &ndash; the potatoes and pasta that we&rsquo;ve somehow managed to gather.</p>

<p>Yesterday our husbands&#8217; bank cards were blocked &ndash; until the situation is cleared, they said &ndash; and now they&rsquo;re unemployed just for fulfilling their duty, for standing outside at 20 degrees below zero, for being burned and poisoned and shot at&hellip;</p>

<p>We have no more tears left &ndash; our husbands were abused so much, and then betrayed! We had a phone call from Lvov today &ndash; a Berkut officer was killed in his own home because he had been at the Maidan. We don&rsquo;t know whom to trust, how to get help and how to feed our children. If someone could help with accommodation for a few months (also in villages), we would be very grateful. We would also be grateful for anything you could bring to our address, Krasnozvezdniy 152a. Some of us also need money to pay for their mobile connection, we receive a lot of calls and we only have mobile Internet left.</p></blockquote>

<p>We contacted with the 4th Dormitory of GU MVD in Ukraine. Their phone number (044) 524-36-96 is in open access to anyone. We&rsquo;ve been told that they have everything and need no help.</p>

<p>We are also happy to learn, that we are not the only ones, who are critical about emotionally charged information. Users of a <a href="http://forum.sevastopol.info/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=752766&amp;start=375&amp;fb_source=message">Sevastopol forum</a> have also called both the dormitory and the people, whose numbers appeared in the appeal for help. They have also been told, that the dormitory does not need help. Calls to the numbers given in the appeal were either left unanswered or there was no connection whatsoever.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is: this information is fake; it is also an attempt to make money on other people&rsquo;s suffering.</p>

<p>If you really want to donate to a good cause &ndash; donate to «<a href="http://tabletochki.org/welcome">Tabletochki</a>» (the red button that says &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;; it works with all kinds of bank cards). The previous government has decided to spend just 50 million UAH (around 5 million EUR) on children who suffer from cancer, which is 4,5 times less than in 2013 and covers just 20% of the real needs (216 million UAH). &ldquo;Ohmatdit&rdquo; &ndash; the most important clinic for such patients &ndash; has mouldy walls.</p>

<p>We can guarantee the honesty of &ldquo;Tabletochki&rdquo;.</p>
