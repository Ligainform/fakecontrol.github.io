  <div class="entry-content"><p>The only thing worse than false information is attempting to use false information for profit. Fraudsters do not ignore current events. On a lot of online sources you may come across something of following kind:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o5hXQoD.png" alt="Imgur" />
(<em>phone numbers and Webmoney wallet numbers have been removed for obvious reasons</em>)</p>

<p>There is a translation of the letter above:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is our cry for help! We appeal to all indifferent people and the authorities! We are the families of the &ldquo;Berkut&rdquo; riot police force who live in a dormitory located in the Krasnozvezdniy Prospekt in Kiev. The last few months we have lived in constant fear for us, our husbands and children. Constant threats, bullying, fear have turned our life into a nightmare. Many of us had to quit their jobs and our children have been bullied at school because our husbands have &ldquo;killed people on the Maidan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Many of us have fled to our relatives, but some have nowhere to go and don&rsquo;t have enough money to flee. The last few days have been absolutely intolerable. All the time there are armed and masked men in front of the dormitory, they are numerous and very aggressive. They don&rsquo;t conceal that they have come to catch Berkut officers. They abuse everyone who enters or leaves the dormitory. They are absolutely unhinged &ndash; yesterday they even beat up the 60-year-old father of one of our women just because he had said something disrespectful about the Maidan. One of our children was walking his dog and these men broke the dog&rsquo;s legs with batons &ndash; and the child saw it all. It&rsquo;s a nightmare!</p>

<p>There are approximately 90 of us left, mostly women, children and older veterans. We also have some wounded young men &ndash; one of them has been badly beaten and had his bones broken, but he is afraid to go to the hospital because our officers are being kidnapped from hospitals.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t even ask for help. Some days ago we called the police &ndash; there came two sergeants and three masked men who threatened and abused us in front of our children and the police. We don&rsquo;t have an Internet connection (someone has cut all the cables) and we regularly have blackouts. We are eating up our last food &ndash; the potatoes and pasta that we&rsquo;ve somehow managed to gather.</p>

<p>Yesterday our husbands&#8217; bank cards were blocked &ndash; until the situation is cleared, they said &ndash; and now they&rsquo;re unemployed just for fulfilling their duty, for standing outside at 20 degrees below zero, for being burned and poisoned and shot at&hellip;</p>

<p>We have no more tears left &ndash; our husbands were abused so much, and then betrayed! We had a phone call from Lvov today &ndash; a Berkut officer was killed in his own home because he had been at the Maidan. We don&rsquo;t know whom to trust, how to get help and how to feed our children. If someone could help with accommodation for a few months (also in villages), we would be very grateful. We would also be grateful for anything you could bring to our address, Krasnozvezdniy 152a. Some of us also need money to pay for their mobile connection, we receive a lot of calls and we only have mobile Internet left.</p></blockquote>

<p>We contacted with the 4th Dormitory of GU MVD in Ukraine. Their phone number (044) 524-36-96 is in open access to anyone. We&rsquo;ve been told that they have everything and need no help.</p>

<p>We are also happy to learn, that we are not the only ones, who are critical about emotionally charged information. Users of a <a href="http://forum.sevastopol.info/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=752766&amp;start=375&amp;fb_source=message">Sevastopol forum</a> have also called both the dormitory and the people, whose numbers appeared in the appeal for help. They have also been told, that the dormitory does not need help. Calls to the numbers given in the appeal were either left unanswered or there was no connection whatsoever.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is: this information is fake; it is also an attempt to make money on other people&rsquo;s suffering.</p>

<p>If you really want to donate to a good cause &ndash; donate to «<a href="http://tabletochki.org/welcome">Tabletochki</a>» (the red button that says &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;; it works with all kinds of bank cards). The previous government has decided to spend just 50 million UAH (around 5 million EUR) on children who suffer from cancer, which is 4,5 times less than in 2013 and covers just 20% of the real needs (216 million UAH). &ldquo;Ohmatdit&rdquo; &ndash; the most important clinic for such patients &ndash; has mouldy walls.</p>

<p>We can guarantee the honesty of &ldquo;Tabletochki&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every day brings new reasons to wonder . Today we were absolutely surprised with unique understanding of geography by the &ldquo;Pervyy kanal&rdquo; tv channel in Russia.</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/posts/2014-03-02/poland.jpg" alt="140,000 refugees" /></p>

<p>In the news story &ldquo;More and more Ukraine citizens arrive to the southern Russian regions&rdquo; First Channel claims that</p>

<p>more than 140 000 people crossed the Russian border in the last two weeks. Among them are not only the residents of Ukraine&rsquo;s East and South, but also of central and western regions.</p>

<p>We are ready to believe the fact that inhabitants of western regions cross the border, however it&rsquo;s claimed that people of Ukraine come to &ldquo;Kursk, Belgorod , Rostov and Bryansk regions &rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re curious whether Poland is aware that it is the part of Russia. Border crossing point Sheginy (the sign can be seen at 00:14 on the video) is situated in Lviv region and is a checkpoint on the border with Poland.</p>

<p><a href="http://service.alfard-bel.ru/tamogna-online-nehoteevka.html">Webcams</a> also transmit empty roads</p>

<p>The project team hopes that the management of the First Channel will deliver a reprimand to their employees and will force them to love geography &ndash; after all, in a ticklish propaganda and fake business such mistakes are a major failure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>So, Mrs. Matvienko described a few moments that pushed the Federation Council to accept the decisions that are being so widely discussed by people of Ukraine (and other countries). As Matvienko notes on the press conference, the approval of Russian President&rsquo;s application on authorising to move forces into Ukraine was conditioned by these key factors: (right now we advice you to open this <a href="http://lifenews.ru/news/128189">link</a> and watch video at the beginning of the article)</p>

<h2>The statements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Russian citizens were injured during the attempt to seize the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Crimea (5:30 and 06:12 on video)</p></li>
<li><p>The abrogation of &ldquo;On Russian Language&rdquo; law and banning Russian speech in Ukraine (06:35 on video)</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Now comes the tasty part</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In his interview to <a href="http://society.lb.ua/accidents/2014/03/01/257781_genkonsul_rossii_krimu.html">LB.ua</a> Vyacheslav Svetlichny, Russian consul general in Crimea, <strong>disproved information</strong> about victims.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also worth mentioning that we never had &ldquo;On Russian Language&rdquo; law, and nobody forbade to speak Russian in our country, as we all know.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>A bit of personal opinion of the author</h2>

<p><em>though we don&rsquo;t practice that</em></p>

<p>The whole Matviyenko&rsquo;s speech was saturated with one idea, which was emphasized many times. The speech amounts to the phrase &ldquo;They beat up our guys&rdquo; (and as we have seen, there was a lot of manipulations with that).
This phrase is very important &ndash; under this very slogan it is possible to get approval by the people to conduct active military actions. They beat up our guys, and it&rsquo;s our duty to defend them. But that is our conclusion, and you should make your conclusions yourself and write them in the comments section on the website or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fakecontrol.org/posts/10202413009639817">on Facebook</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong> UPD: the statement made by Andriy Parubiy (Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine) at March 2, 2014: </strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0dLJcZBMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0dLJcZBMM</a></p>

<p>Once the current post appears on Facebook &ndash; we experienced a lot of mess in comments.
<img src="http://d.pr/i/5BRh+" alt="mob" />
We felt nervous about that so we decided to get in touch with state military registration and enlistment office at Kharkiv. Eventually we&rsquo;ve got following response:</p>

<ul>
<li>Military offices watch the situation and people bother them with calls all the time.</li>
<li>There is no official order regards military mobilization.</li>
<li>The official order is pending signature from The President.</li>
<li>The official order should be advertised on media (at least on national television network).</li>
<li>There is no reason for panic.</li>
</ul>


<p>We have a record of those conversation, but a permission to share was not granted &ndash; so we&rsquo;ve listened to it by ourselves and you have to trust us. Or even better call to your local military office and ask appropriate questions :)</p>

<p>This is the most correct strategy in current situation.</p>

<p>We would not be surprised, if in the morning we will find out that Parubiy&rsquo;s Facebook page was hacked or it&rsquo;s just a fake account, which everybody read by unknown reason.</p>

<p>Please check all the information. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by fakes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOmpICEfN5o">video on the web</a> (shared couple of days ago) with the following description:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Posted on February 20, 2014.</strong>
American mercenaries fight on Maidan&rsquo;s side. It has been clearly demonstrated by the documents which were seized from the captured soldiers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Below we may find “irrefutable” evidences:</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/P3qI+" alt="screen1" />
<em>ID Cover</em></p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/IUl5+" alt="screen2" />
<em>The Logo of a certain organization titled IPA</em></p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/AniK+" alt="screen3" />
<em>The ID itself</em></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the police does not know of the existence of <a href="http://www.ipa-ua.org">IPA</a> – an international police organization that Ukraine is a member of.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Ukrainian division of the International Police Association was created on April 25, 1996. In 1997, during the XV World Congress of the IPA in the Canadian city of Quebec, the Ukrainian section gained official recognition in the International Police Association. Today, the IPA comprises of about 8000 members.</p>

<p>Ukrainian IPA section works, consistently putting into practice the primary IPA motto: &ldquo;Serve Through Friendship!&rdquo;. Communication with foreign colleagues, exchange of delegations, common international events &ndash; every activity by the Association members under our country&rsquo;s colors is a contribution of Ukrainian section of IPA to the extension of the professional and friendly relationships between law enforcement officers in different countries, and, eventually, to ensuring peace and friendship on our planet.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scariest part of the story that people blindly believe in such things. They believe in fake images without even checking obvious facts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we found a picture that shows one of the most famous Hitler portraits hanging over the entrance to Kyiv Municipal State Administration. One could laugh, but the image is quickly being shared by Russian trashy websites, low quality personal blogs, local European news sources and social networks.</p>

<p>If you open the image in Adobe Photoshop and apply Rainbow Curve over the image, you may found that the portrait&rsquo;s density is different from the rest of the picture. But this isn’t even necessary, as you can spot the editing with the naked eye.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Olha Bohomolets in her post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/olgabogomolets/posts/585812244842541">said</a> that the Ukrainian Red Cross Society refused to accept help from the Canadian Red Cross. This information was reposted by <a href="http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25270523.html">Radio Svoboda</a> and <a href="http://argumentua.com/novosti/ocherednaya-dikost-ukrainskii-krasnyi-krest-otkazalsya-peredat-pomoshch-iz-kanady">Argument</a>) on their pages. But there is an official verification that this information is false!</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross updated their  Twitter-account with the following <a href="https://twitter.com/ICRC/status/436883171230367744">message</a>
: “Rumour about Ukrainian Red Cross refusing aid from Canadian Red Cross is FALSE. @redcrosscanada didn’t send any official offer for aid.”</p>

<p>It means Canadian Red Cross did not offer their help to Ukranian Red Cross. It would be nice if all involved parts would clarify this issue. And you are welcome to share these news.Thanks a lot,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe everyone has read/heard the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/30127.html">President&rsquo;s statement</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, there are the following words:&ldquo;Rybak came to me yesterday. While he was on his way to me, the car was fired on. He came to me and asked to take him away. I took him away and sent him to Donetsk by car to have medical treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And today Vladimir Rybak uploaded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=639362169451922">this video</a>) of him saying is saying that no one ever attempted the life of him.</p>

<p>Enjoy watching, we will refrain from conclusions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Reliable sources also say that Lubka doesn&rsquo;t say hello, so she must be a slut, and that boyfriend of hers is a junkie!&#8221;These days we&rsquo;ve heard quite a lot about Volodymyr Matvienko&rsquo;s decision to leave the Party of Regions. It is rumoured that he was forced to do so because his child has been kidnapped.</p>

<p>The source of this information is &ldquo;Andrei Vajra, political analyst&rdquo;, as WA REX <a href="http://www.iarex.ru/articles/45411.html">tells us</a> (&ldquo;WA REX is Russian wire agency, not a foreign agent&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Andrey Vadzhra seems to be <a href="http://www.iarex.ru/keywords/601.html">frequently quoted</a>
 by this agency.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had a look at the <a href="http://andreyvadjra.livejournal.com">analyst&rsquo;s blog</a> on LiveJournal and found lots of wonderful stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, unknown people broke through a bank&rsquo;s wall and took all the money.&rdquo; Every word is amazing &ndash; just imagine them breaking (!) through a wall (!!!) and escaping with all (!!!) the money! (By the way, this amazing piece of news actually appeared in some Russian media, citing Mr Vadzhra&rsquo;s blog as the source).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently 236 deputies voted for removing riot police from the centre of Kyiv and cancelling the anti-terrorist operation. The chairman, however, did not sign the decree, so it cannot take effect.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s totally strange that a &ldquo;political expert&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t know his own country&rsquo;s legislation. Dear Andrey, should you be reading this, here&rsquo;s an interesting <a href="http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1861-17">link</a> for you, and <a href="http://vybor.ua/article/zakonotvorchestvo/verhovnaya-rada-ukrainy-20-fevralya-2014.html">here</a> are some excerpts from the respective laws and some expert commentary as well).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Armed skirmishes began between Berkut officers and the &#8220;Right Sector&rdquo; neonazis in the centre of Kyiv. The Verkovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers have been evacuated. My sources inform that there is a fight in the Cabinet&rsquo;s building.&ldquo; Well yes, Andrey has the most reliable sources ever.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://andreyvadjra.livejournal.com">LJ blog</a> and <a href="http://alternatio.org/">website</a> are full of this kind of &ldquo;news&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re totally worth looking at.</p>

<p>Do we need to say that it&rsquo;s not easy to believe things said by someone whose sources are SO reliable?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, Russian TV channels distinguished themselves though their coverage of the events in Ukraine. Journalists from Vesti.ru on channel “Russia24” quite accidentally forgot to show the most important and interesting part of <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/only_video.html?vid=578577">the segment</a>.</p>

<p>For your comparison, <a href="http://atn.ua/proisshestviya/kak-izbivali-pod-akademiey-vv-podrobnosti-shturma">here</a> are the same events covered by channel ATN Kharkov.</p>

<p>The urge to attach an old photo posted on the satirical Twitter account dedicated to the work of Dmitry Kiselev is irresistible.</p>
